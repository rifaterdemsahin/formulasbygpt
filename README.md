# Coding Formulas & Learning Steps Repository

Welcome to the **Coding Formulas & Learning Steps** repository! This repo contains structured learning materials designed for a self-learning system that separates concepts into **symbols**, **formulas**, and **execution**. The content here is organized into memory cards and categorized for efficient learning and quick reference.

## Overview

This repository serves as a central hub for storing coding formulas and learning steps. It is tailored for a self-learning system where concepts are broken down into smaller components, enabling a focused learning experience. The memory cards are categorized into:

- **Symbols**: Basic building blocks, such as syntax, keywords, and operators.
- **Formulas**: Logical constructs or combinations of symbols that achieve a specific task or functionality.
- **Execution**: Detailed steps on how to implement and execute the formulas in practical coding scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repo is structured as follows:

```plaintext
├── symbols/
│   ├── language1/
│   ├── language2/
├── formulas/
│   ├── topic1/
│   ├── topic2/
├── execution/
│   ├── project1/
│   ├── project2/
├── README.md
```

- `symbols/`: Contains files describing the basic elements of various programming languages (syntax, keywords, operators, etc.).
- `formulas/`: Contains logical structures or formulas that solve specific coding problems.
- `execution/`: Contains step-by-step instructions to execute specific formulas in real-world coding scenarios.

## Memory Card Categories

### Symbols

This section focuses on the **symbols** used in programming languages, including:

- Variables
- Data types
- Control structures
- Operators

### Formulas

In this section, you’ll find **formulas** or reusable patterns to solve common coding problems. These include:

- Algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)
- Logical operations
- Design patterns

### Execution

This section walks through **execution** steps for applying formulas in practical scenarios:

- Project setups
- Implementing formulas in real-world applications
- Debugging and optimization tips

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coding-formulas.git
   ```

2. **Navigate the directories** to find the learning materials you need.

3. Use the memory cards to guide your learning. Start with the **Symbols**, then move on to **Formulas**, and finally apply the knowledge in the **Execution** section.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a useful formula, symbol, or execution step you'd like to share, please follow the guidelines below:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution.
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
