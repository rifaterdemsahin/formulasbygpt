To create an ArgoCD workflow that includes a Tekton `Pipeline`, `PipelineRun`, tasks, and controllers that target a PVC (Persistent Volume Claim), you need to define several components. Below is a sample workflow that includes:

1. **ArgoCD Application** for syncing your Tekton pipeline resources.
2. **Tekton Task** which defines the steps.
3. **Tekton Pipeline** which defines the sequence of tasks.
4. **Tekton PipelineRun** to trigger the pipeline.
5. **PVC** for storage in the pipeline.

### 1. **ArgoCD Application**
This defines the application in ArgoCD that will sync the Tekton pipeline definitions from a Git repository.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: tekton-pipeline
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: 'https://github.com/your-repo/tekton-pipeline.git'
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: 'pipelines'
  destination:
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
    namespace: tekton-pipelines
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

### 2. **PVC (Persistent Volume Claim)**
This PVC will be used by the Tekton tasks to store data.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: tekton-workspace-pvc
  namespace: tekton-pipelines
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

### 3. **Tekton Task**
Define the steps that will run in the Tekton pipeline. Here, the task will write some data to the PVC.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: write-to-pvc
  namespace: tekton-pipelines
spec:
  workspaces:
    - name: workspace
  steps:
    - name: write
      image: ubuntu
      script: |
        echo "Writing data to workspace" > /workspace/workspace/data.txt
      volumeMounts:
        - name: tekton-workspace-pvc
          mountPath: /workspace/workspace
```

### 4. **Tekton Pipeline**
This pipeline will include the task that targets the PVC. You can include multiple tasks depending on your workflow.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: pvc-pipeline
  namespace: tekton-pipelines
spec:
  workspaces:
    - name: workspace
  tasks:
    - name: write-task
      taskRef:
        name: write-to-pvc
      workspaces:
        - name: workspace
          workspace: shared-workspace
```

### 5. **Tekton PipelineRun**
This will trigger the pipeline and bind the workspace to the PVC.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: pvc-pipeline-run
  namespace: tekton-pipelines
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: pvc-pipeline
  workspaces:
    - name: workspace
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: tekton-workspace-pvc
  podTemplate:
    volumes:
      - name: tekton-workspace-pvc
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: tekton-workspace-pvc
```

### Steps Summary:
1. The **ArgoCD Application** syncs Tekton resources from the Git repository.
2. The **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** is used by Tekton to store intermediate data.
3. The **Tekton Task** writes data to the PVC.
4. The **Tekton Pipeline** defines the execution order of tasks.
5. The **PipelineRun** binds the PVC to the pipeline and triggers its execution.

You would apply these manifests to your Kubernetes cluster, and ArgoCD will sync and manage the pipeline resources from the Git repository.

### Workflow Summary:
- ArgoCD manages the deployment of the Tekton pipeline and resources.
- Tekton runs the pipeline with tasks that store data in a PVC.
