To fix your Azure DevOps YAML pipeline, a few minor changes can be made to ensure it's fully functional and pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub correctly.

### Updated YAML Pipeline:

```yaml
trigger:
- main

resources:
- repo: self

variables:
  system.debug: true
  tag: '$(Build.BuildId)'   # Build ID for unique tag
  imageName: 'pexabo/thanoslistener'   # Docker image name including Docker Hub username

stages:
- stage: Build
  displayName: Build and Push Docker Image
  jobs:
  - job: Build
    displayName: Build Docker Image
    pool:
      vmImage: ubuntu-latest   # Pool for Ubuntu agent
      parallel: 1   # Run sequentially (not in parallel)
    steps:
    # Login to Docker Hub
    - task: Docker@2
      displayName: 'Login to Docker Hub'
      inputs:
        command: login
        containerRegistry: 'DockerHub'   # Reference to Docker Hub service connection

    # Build the Docker image
    - task: Docker@2
      displayName: 'Build Docker Image'
      inputs:
        command: build
        dockerfile: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/Dockerfile'   # Make sure the Dockerfile is correctly named and located
        repository: $(imageName)   # Repository name for the image
        tags: |
          $(imageName):$(Build.BuildId)
          $(imageName):latest

    # Push the Docker image to Docker Hub
    - task: Docker@2
      displayName: 'Push Docker Image'
      inputs:
        command: push
        repository: $(imageName)   # Push the built image to Docker Hub
        tags: |
          $(imageName):$(Build.BuildId)
          $(imageName):latest
```

### Changes made:

1. **`dockerfile` path**: I updated `dockerfile: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/Dockerfile'` to ensure the file is correctly referenced with its full path.
2. **`repository` input for `build` and `push` commands**: The `repository` field in both build and push steps now includes `$(imageName)` to make sure the Docker image is properly tagged and pushed.
3. **Image tags**: Image tags are set to include both the `Build.BuildId` for a unique identifier and the `latest` tag.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that your **Docker Hub service connection** is correctly configured in Azure DevOps. This should be created under **Project Settings > Service Connections** in Azure DevOps, where you define your Docker Hub credentials. You should name this connection `DockerHub` to match the YAML.
- Confirm that your Dockerfile is named `Dockerfile` and is located in the root directory of your source code, or adjust the path accordingly.

By making these adjustments, the pipeline should now successfully build and push your Docker image to Docker Hub.
